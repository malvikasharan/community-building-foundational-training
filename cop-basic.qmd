## üè° Key takeaways

**In this session, we discussed the Mountain/Matrix of engagement to understand what different levels of engagement look like and how we facilitate that.**

We explored questions and frameworks to understand these aspects:
- How do we move from one level to another? When to recognise someone can move from one band to another?
- Mountain of Engagement should be a living document, reflecting on what your community experiences are and where you should modify them.
