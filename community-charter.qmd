## Vision: Articulating your big ideas (for the future)

### Prompts for vision

- What you are doing - Why you are doing this - the impact or change your project will bring - Who are users and contributors

## Mission:** Where you are right now, what your objectives are, what is next.

### Prompts for Mission

- What the objectives are - What does your project offers and what makes it unique - What the next steps are (Process for community engagement and project development)

## Roadmap: an overview of the project's goals and outcomes presented on a timeline.

- Roadmap is supplemented with details such as scope, resources, ways of working, risks
- Roadmap does not provide task-level details. (For task-level details, see project charter).
- Information gathered so far can be put together in a project charter, or maintained through separate documents. You can consider adding more details. (Prompts in the assignment)

### Reflection for the future

What is the definition of success for us in 6 months/12 months/2 years (based on where you are)?
