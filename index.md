# Foundational Community Building and Engagement Training

> *We cannot expect to engage with and refer to communities unless we first support them to be built from inside out. â€˜Communityâ€™ should be understood as a verb, not a noun, in other words it is the consequence of our efforts.* - Cormac Russell, Rikindling Democracy

## Building communities with a sense of purpose and belonging

Hi everyone, I am Malvika Sharan.
I am an Open Science practitioner with a strong focus and nudge towards community building.
A lot of what I know and teach, comes from my experience working in Open Research projects - previously in bioinformatics and since 2019, in data science and research more broadly. 
I explore and apply open research practices and approaches to transfer knowledge across different open source or community-led data science projects and also in 'not so open' research projects.

You can find more about me via my [homepage](https://malvikasharan.github.io/), and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MalvikaSharan) for rare moments where I share something (which has reduced significantly in 2023!)
