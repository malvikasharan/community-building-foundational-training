**In this session, we will build a clear understanding of :**

- what different resources and processes in our community exist
- what do different kinds of community participation and engagement look like
- what values do we create for our community members to participate in our community and engage with our work
- what processes work that can be used to iterate and improve all forms of participation and build a fair value exchange (support and acknowledgement) system

_ **Mapping community information, community process, the mountain of engagement and value exchange** _

- Discover how people interact with your community, organisation, or project and its culture.
- Discover how people identify and move between different types of interactions.
- Develop pathways for people to move from first contact to sustained engagement to leadership

## üè° Key takeaways

**In this next session we discussed the Mountain/Matrix of engagement to understand what different levels of engagement looks like and how we facilitate that.**

We explored questions and frameworks to understand these aspects:
- How do we move our community contributors/stakeholders from one level to another? When to recognise someone can move from one band to another?
- Mountain of Engagement should be a living document, reflecting on what your community experiences are and where you should modify them.
