> *Just because you can draw a detailed map, doesn‚Äôt mean you are accurately representing the territory!* - Yuval Noah Harari

## Key lessons

* Building a mountain/matrix of engagement
* Understanding and mapping incentives and value-exchange

### To ensure equitable community participation, it's important to map the following information:

* what different resources and processes in our community exist
* what do different kinds of community participation and engagement look like
* what values do we create for our community members to participate in our community and engage with our work
* what processes work that can be used to iterate and improve all forms of participation and build a fair value exchange (support and acknowledgement) system

### We will utilise the mountain/matrix of engagement to map community processes and  value exchange:

* Discover how people interact with your community, organisation, or project and its culture.
* Discover how people identify and move between different types of interactions.
* Develop pathways for people to move from first contact to sustained engagement to leadership
* Embed value-exchange and fair recognition process in the project

## üè° Key takeaways

In this session, we discussed:
* The Mountain/Matrix of engagement to understand what different levels of engagement look like and how we facilitate that.
* How do we move from one level to another? When to recognise someone can move from one band to another?
* Mountain of Engagement should be a living document, reflecting on what your community experiences are and where you should modify them.
