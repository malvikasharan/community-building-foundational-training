    "text": "Building communities with a sense of purpose and belonging\nCommunity building is a process of enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project. Community managers or members in community coordination roles identify and build meaningful pathways for everyone to gain access to the skills and resources they need to participate in the community. They carry out project-specific technical roles alongside emergent and often non-quantifiable and invisible responsibilities in the community needed to make the quality and visible work of their communities effective. These background works involve approaches for collaboration, maintenance, acknowledgement and capturing the impact of community members‚Äô work - skills that can be learned and systematically applied to all research work.\nThis training material has been designed to discuss foundational skills through four modules, each designed for short-form project-based discussion:\n\nModule 1: üöß Community foundation: What is your community‚Äôs story, who started it, what was the reason/purpose and where do we want to take it?\nModule 2: üî§ Community of Practice basics: Purpose and outcomes, stakeholder mapping, roles and responsibility documentation and communication channels\nModule 3: üó∫ Community engagement: information mapping, a mountain of engagement, incentives and value-exchange\nModule 4: üìú Creating and communicating your community charter: vision, mission, milestones, roadmap, ways of working"

    "text": "üñ• Part 1: Community and Community of Practice (CoP)\n[Link to the Google Slides]\nExample 1\n_ In 2012 at an office party, two employees exchanged their interest in _ growing vegetables and flowers. They decided to set up an interest group who would like to exchange their tips, tricks and produce from their gardens/farms. Within a few months, they set up an Instagram to post pictures of their products to share online. Next year, more members joined them by renting an allotment near their office space and met after work to go to the allotment and grow vegetables together. Following summer, a few members wrote a proposal for their organisation to fund their group to pay for the allotment rent, purchase common tools and seeds and support their group to improve socialisation. Now, every year their organisation hosts a yearly harvest party where produce from the shared allotment is sold to the staff members to raise funds for a local charity. Their music band plays live music and a baking group shares free cakes and tea to engage more people at this event.\nExample 2\n_ In 2019, two employees exchanged their scientific goals for _ open science training for people in the biology field. They connected with another member who had a similar interest to write a proposal to join an accelerator programme and build a project that will allow them to train and mentor early career researchers in open science. Soon, they launched their programme and opened a call for experts in their area to join as mentors. In 2020, they received 20 applications from researchers interested in receiving training. The program‚Äôs success attracted 60 applications the next year and the previous trainees joined to mentor the next group. In 2021, they received grants to hire people, provide funding to their participants and scale their effort by offering this programme to people in other research fields. Now their trainees are not only mentors but also trainers of this programme in their network and frequently answer questions from new members.\nExample 3\n_ In 2018 at a Data Study Group workshop, two industry leaders, one from academia and one from the private sector, exchanged their interest in each other‚Äôs work _ in AI and Health Research. They went back to their organisations to find organisation buy-in to set a formal collaboration so that researchers across these organisations can collaborate on exciting and innovative ideas that advance each organisation‚Äôs mission and reputation as industry leaders. They invested funding to hire community managers and researchers to work in the interface of their organisation. Soon, they launched engagement initiatives and opened a call for experts in their area to apply for funding schemes on topics of shared interest. They were successful in their first year, and are excited about the possibility of the next 5 years.\n\nOpen discussions\n\nWhat trend do we see in these two scenarios?\nWhat are the differences?\n\n\n\nStarting with ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?\n\nWhy does the project need a community?\nWhy did you take on this community role?\nWhy would others join this community?\nHow do these different sets of ‚Äòpurpose‚Äô align?\n\n\nSilent note-taking using prompts\n1.
