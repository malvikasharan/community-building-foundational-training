    "text": "We cannot expect to engage with and refer to communities unless we first support them to be built from inside out. ‘Community’ should be understood as a verb, not a noun, in other words it is the consequence of our efforts. - Cormac Russell, Rikindling Democracy\n\n\n\nHi everyone, I am Malvika Sharan. I am an Open Science practitioner with a strong focus and nudge towards community building. A lot of what I know and teach, comes from my experience working in Open Research projects - previously in bioinformatics and since 2019, in data science and research more broadly. I explore and apply open research practices and approaches to transfer knowledge across different open source or community-led data science projects and also in ‘not so open’ research projects.\nYou can find more about me via my homepage, and follow me on Twitter for rare moments where I share something (which has reduced significantly in 2023!)\n\n\n\n\nModule 1: 🚧 Community foundation: What is your community’s story, who started it, what was the reason/purpose and where do we want to take it?\nModule 2: 🔤 Community of Practice basics: Purpose and outcomes, stakeholder mapping, roles and responsibility documentation and communication channels\nModule 3: 🗺 Community engagement: information mapping, a mountain of engagement, incentives and value-exchange\nModule 4: 📜 Creating and communicating your community charter: vision, mission, milestones, roadmap, ways of working\nModule 5: 🔓 Open Science/research framework: applying open, equitable and participatory approaches for building communities\n\n\n\n\nFor any organisation-related queries or concerns, you can directly reach out to the project lead and author Malvika Sharan by emailing msharan@turing.ac.uk.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under the MIT license (code) and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (for documentation).

They decided to set up an interest group who would like to exchange their tips, tricks and produce from their gardens/farms. Within a few months, they set up an Instagram to post pictures of their products to share online. Next year, more members joined them by renting an allotment near their office space and met after work to go to the allotment and grow vegetables together. Following summer, a few members wrote a proposal for their organisation to fund their group to pay for the allotment rent, purchase common tools and seeds and support their group to improve socialisation. Now, every year their organisation hosts a yearly harvest party where produce from the shared allotment is sold to the staff members to raise funds for a local charity. Their music band plays live music and a baking group shares free cakes and tea to engage more people at this event.\nExample 2\n_ In 2019, two employees exchanged their scientific goals for _ open science training for people in the biology field. They connected with another member who had a similar interest to write a proposal to join an accelerator programme and build a project that will allow them to train and mentor early career researchers in open science. Soon, they launched their programme and opened a call for experts in their area to join as mentors. In 2020, they received 20 applications from researchers interested in receiving training. The program’s success attracted 60 applications the next year and the previous trainees joined to mentor the next group. In 2021, they received grants to hire people, provide funding to their participants and scale their effort by offering this programme to people in other research fields. Now their trainees are not only mentors but also trainers of this programme in their network and frequently answer questions from new members.\nExample 3\n_ In 2018 at a Data Study Group workshop, two industry leaders, one from academia and one from the private sector, exchanged their interest in each other’s work _ in AI and Health Research. They went back to their organisations to find organisation buy-in to set a formal collaboration so that researchers across these organisations can collaborate on exciting and innovative ideas that advance each organisation’s mission and reputation as industry leaders. They invested funding to hire community managers and researchers to work in the interface of their organisation. Soon, they launched engagement initiatives and opened a call for experts in their area to apply for funding schemes on topics of shared interest. They were successful in their first year, and are excited about the possibility of the next 5 years.\n\n\nQ1: What trend do we see in these two scenarios?\n\nInitial opportunity to connect\nGrowth over time is purpose-driven\nParticipants response …\n\n\n\nQ2: What are the differences?\n\nSome need more funding and institutional recognition than others to grow.\nNeed to create funding structures/models\nParticipants response …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the project need a community?\nWhy did you take on this community role?\nWhy would others join this community?\nHow do these different sets of ‘purpose’ align?\n\n✏️ Silent note-taking using prompts\nProject: Why does the project need a community?\n\nWhat is your community project’s story, who started it?
